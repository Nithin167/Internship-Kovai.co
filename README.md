Task-1
These are some of the insights analysed from the given data set
1) Percentage Contribution of Each Route Type:
     It clearly shows people mostly use the Local Route the most(30.66%) compared to the others.
2) Total Usage by Route Type:
     By this we analyse the route usage and find how many number of people used the routes which is calculated only for the highest routes used by the people.
3) Total School Route Usage:
     The School route usage is of 7.29% and it does not change beacue it is the unique route available to travel for school and the total usage is calculated(4512469).
4) Total Usage by Route Type:
     To visualize more easily a bar graph has been created between number of passengers and route type involving the three most commonly used route types(Local Route, Light Rail, Rapid Route).
5) Peak Service Usage Over Time:
     An insight for the peak service route has been visualized for a better understanding.


Task-2
This Task 2 Python code will analyze and forecast public transport passenger journey data. Using the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing algorithm, the code provides insights into the data and forecasts ridership for the next 7 days. The dataset includes various route types such as Local Route, Light Rail, Peak Service, Rapid Route, and School routes.

we use this exponential smoothing process because it is the most advanced smoothening technique and it forcasts the result based on the the intercept, trend, andseasonal component.
